2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer spi_0_sck_iobuf/IBUF (in spi_0_sck_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer spi_0_ss_iobuf/IBUF (in spi_0_ss_iobuf macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-28#1 Advisory
enum_USE_MULT_NONE_connects_CEM_GND  
Fir_filter_i/filter/fir/U0/i_synth/g_single_rate.i_single_rate/g_op_paths[0].g_combine.i_ext_mult/g_two_col_comb.i_gen_upper_bits/i_add_accum/g_dsp48.g_dsp48e1.i_dsp48e1: When the DSP48E1 USE_MULT attribute is set to NONE, the CEM input pin should be tied to GND to save power.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-30#1 Advisory
enum_MREG_0_connects_CEM_GND  
Fir_filter_i/filter/fir/U0/i_synth/g_single_rate.i_single_rate/g_op_paths[0].g_combine.i_ext_mult/g_two_col_comb.i_gen_upper_bits/i_add_accum/g_dsp48.g_dsp48e1.i_dsp48e1: When the DSP48E1 MREG attribute is set to 0, the CEM input pin should be tied to GND to save power.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-181#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (Fir_filter_i/filter/fir_dma/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_MM2S_FULL.I_MM2S_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_INCLUDE_MM2S_SF.I_RD_SF/I_DATA_FIFO/BLK_MEM.I_SYNC_FIFOGEN_FIFO/xpm_fifo_instance.xpm_fifo_sync_inst/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
