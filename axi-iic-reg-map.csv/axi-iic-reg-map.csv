SOFTR,0x040,,read-write,32,"Soft Reset Register"
,,RKEY,write-only,[3:0],"Reset Key - Firmware must write a value of 0xA to this field to
            cause a soft reset of the Interrupt registers of AXI IIC controller.
            Writing any other value results in an AXI transaction
            acknowledgement with SLVERR and no reset occurs.
"
CR,0x100,,read-write,32,"Control Register"
,,EN,read-write,[0],"This bit must be set before any other CR bits have any effect
0 - resets and disables the AXI IIC controller but not the registers or FIFOs
1 - enables the AXI IIC controller
"
,,TX_FIFO_Reset,read-write,[1],"This bit must be set to flush the FIFO if either (a) arbitration is lost or (b) if a transmit error occurs
0 - transmit FIFO normal operation
1 - resets the transmit FIFO
"
,,MSMS,read-write,[2],"When this bit is changed from 0 to 1, the
AXI IIC bus interface generates a START condition in master mode. When
this bit is cleared, a STOP condition is generated and the AXI IIC bus
interface switches to slave mode. When this bit is cleared by the
hardware, because arbitration for the bus has been lost, a STOP
condition is not generated
"
,,TX,read-write,[3],"This bit selects the direction of master/slave transfers.
0 - selects an AXI IIC receive
1 - selects an AXI IIC transmit
"
,,TXAK,read-write,[4],"This bit specifies the value driven onto
the sda line during acknowledge cycles for both master and slave recievers.
0 - acknowledge
1 - not-acknowledge
"
,,RSTA,read-write,[5],"Writing a 1 to this bit generates a repeated START 
condition on the bus if the AXI IIC bus interface is the current bus
master. Attempting a repeated START at the wrong time, if the bus is
owned by another master, results in a loss of arbitration. This bit is reset
when the repeated start occurs. This bit must be set prior to writing the
new address to the TX_FIFO or DTR
"
,,GC_EN,read-write,[6],"Setting this bit High allows the AXI IIC to respond to a general call address.
0 - General Call Disabled
1 - General Call Enabled
"
SR,0x104,,read-only,32,"Status Register"
,,ABGC,read-only,[0],"This bit is set to 1 when another master has issued a general call and
the general call enable bit is set to 1, CR(6) = 1.
"
,,AAS,read-only,[1],"When the address on the IIC bus matches the slave address in the Address register (ADR), the IIC bus interface
is being addressed as a slave and switches to slave mode. If 10-bit addressing is selected this device only responds to a 10-bit
address or general call if enabled. This bit is cleared when a stop
condition is detected or a repeated start occurs.
0 - indicates not being addressed as a slave
1 - indicates being addressed as a slave
"
,,BB,read-only,[2],"This bit indicates the status of the IIC bus. This bit is set
when a START condition is detected and cleared when a STOP
condition is detected.
0 - indicates the bus is idle
1 - indicates the bus is busy
"
,,SRW,read-only,[3],"When the IIC bus interface has been addressed as a slave (AAS is set), 
this bit indicates the value of the read/write bit sent by the master.
This bit is only valid when a complete transfer has occurred and
no other transfers have been initiated.
0 - indicates master writing to slave
1 - indicates master reading from slave
"
,,TX_FIFO_Full,read-only,[4],"This bit is set High when the transmit FIFO is full.
"
,,RX_FIFO_Full,read-only,[5],"This bit is set High when the receive FIFO is full.
This bit is set only when all 16 locations in the FIFO are full,
regardless of the compare value field of the RX_FIFO_PIRQ register.
"
,,RX_FIFO_Empty,read-only,[6],"This is set High when the receive FIFO is empty.
"
,,TX_FIFO_Empty,read-only,[7],"This is set High when the transmit FIFO is empty.
"
TX_FIFO,0x108,,write-only,32,"Transmit FIFO Register"
,,D7_D0,write-only,[7:0],"If the dynamic stop bit is used and the AXI IIC is a master receiver,
the value is the number of bytes to receive.
"
,,Start,write-only,[8],"The dynamic start bit can be used to send a start or repeated start sequence on the
IIC bus. A start sequence is generated if the MSMS = 0, a
repeated start sequence is generated if the MSMS = 1.
"
,,Stop,write-only,[9],"The dynamic stop bit can be used to send an IIC stop
sequence on the IIC bus after the last byte has been transmitted or received.

TX_FIFO_OCY,0x114,,read-only,32,"Transmit FIFO Occupency Register"
,,Occupancy_Value,read-only,[3:0],"Bit[3] is the MSB. A binary value of 1001 indicates that
10 locations are full in the FIFO
"
RX_FIFO_OCY,0x118,,read-only,32,"Recieve FIFO Occupency Register"
,,Occupancy_Value,read-only,[3:0],"Bit[3] is the MSB. A binary value of 1001 indicates that

,,Compare_Value,read-write,[3:0],"Bit[3] is the MSB. A binary value of 1001 implies that when
10 locations in the receive FIFO are filled, the receive FIFO
interrupt is set.
